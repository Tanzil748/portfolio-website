      <p>
        Hi there! I graduated from John Jay College in June 2022 with a
        Bachelors of Science in Computer Science & Information Security. Growing
        up, I've always been fascinated by computers, but I became truly
        interested in computer science only after I attended a coding event at
        my college.
        <br />
        <br />I constantly look for opportunities to grow my technical skillset.
        I dabbled in data analytics and learned how to analyze large datasets.
        However, after exploring some more, I soon realized that web development
        was what drew my attention the most. Nowadays, I enjoy building up my
        MERN stack skills by building apps in my free time. I'm a lifelong
        learner and my eventual plan is to try building apps in React Native.
